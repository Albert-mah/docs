# Sub-details

## Introduction

Sub-details serve as the dedicated components for sub-forms in reading mode. Unlike label and title components, sub-details provide the ability to display more extensive data from the current table and enable the configuration of related table data. This allows multi-level relational data to be presented clearly in a nested format.
