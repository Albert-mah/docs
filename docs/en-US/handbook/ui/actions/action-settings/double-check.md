# Double check

## Introduction

The Double check configuration is designed to ensure that an operation is deliberate before it proceeds. When an action is clicked, a confirmation box will appear. By default, the delete button has secondary confirmation enabled to prevent accidental operations that could lead to data loss or irreversible outcomes.
