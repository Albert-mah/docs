## Introduction

The "Save as Block Template" feature allows you to preserve a block and its associated data tables as a reusable template. These templates are centrally managed in the template management page, streamlining your workflow when creating new blocks. When adding blocks to your project, you can either reference an existing template or create a copy, enabling rapid and consistent block creation.
